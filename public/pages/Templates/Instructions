To create your own page:

- select one of the templates in this folder
- download the file and add your content to it
- name the file [namelastname].html
- upload the file to the Students or Faculty folder
- upload your picture to the images folder
- [merge your changes to the master branch]?

Both templates have instructions on how to insert your content. The basics are: name, picture, and one or more paragraphs. 

If you would like to have more structured content, the template with columns provides an additional double column section.
